- adjust grouping, sorting and level of detail
- save as [folders and bookmarks](artwork/screenshot-bookmarks.png)
- or copy data to spreadsheet

## Development

### Running in test mode

If you don't have any Great Suspender tabs saved, you can check the extension works by adding a manual query to the URL:

```
?text=hello&limit=100
```

### Scripts

The extension is not currently compiled, but there is a build / release process.

To install the packages:

```bash
npm i
```

Before releasing, modify the `src/manifest` version:

```txt
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
}
```


Then run the release script:

```bash
npm run release
```

This will release to a folder called `releases` one level above the repository root.
